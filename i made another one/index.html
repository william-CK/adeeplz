			Beginning

			It was 11 years ago when they first met (I know, time hurts). They were very young and simple, 

			normal kids who go to school. They never knew it will be the doorway to find love and destiny.

			June 2005, it was this time their paths crossed. It was the typical high school setup, developing their 

			likes, dislikes, love, and a lot more. 

			It was the first glance that he knew, she was the one. After half a year of patiently courting, she 

			finally said yes. Both were thrilled with their new journey together. 

			Relationships demand a lot of things. Due to young age, both decided to explore life. She has been 

			blessed to see the other side of the world and he continued on to fulfil his goals.  

			LDR moments

			Communication has never failed both of them. It was the care they have for each other that kept it. 

			5 years have passed and they realised, love truly finds its way. The seed of love in them grew. The 

			fire was rekindled. 

			February 2010, it was this time their love was given a second chance. This was not your typical 

			relationship; this is what two lovers fear, a long distance relationship, and 3,615 miles apart. It 

			requires huge amount of sacrifice, patience, and understanding. It was never easy for them. 

			Gratefully, they stood together, fought, and held on to their unwavering love. The fruit of their 

			labour and endurance was true happiness; knowing they both have each other. 

			Being together

			4 long years have passed and they were blessed to finally be together; a sweet reward for all their 

			sacrifices. They stuck together through the ups and downs of life. They now enjoy the true essence 

			of life, going through challenges, making decisions, discovering strengths TOGETHER. 

			December 16, 2016, it will be this date that theyâ€™ve decided to tie the knot forever. It will be a long 

			road for them, but being together for eternity is the foundation of everything. Please join them on 

			their wedding hahahhahaha
